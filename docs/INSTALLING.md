# Download and Install SkyHanni

SkyHanni is a Forge mod for **Minecraft 1.8.9 only**.
Running SkyHanni on Badlion, Lunar, Feather, or newer versions of Minecraft is **not supported**.

Follow this guide to install SkyHanni in regular Minecraft Forge.
If you already have Forge mods, you can skip to step 4. Otherwise, start from step 1.
If you already have the latest alpha version from NEU, you can skip to step 5.

> **1: Run vanilla 1.8.9**
> Run Minecraft 1.8.9, unmodded, for 10 seconds, then close it.

> **2: Install Java**
> To play with mods, you need Java 8.
> Install [Java 8](<https://www.java.com/en/download/>).
> Double-click the file to install it.

> **3: Install Forge**
> Forge is the system that loads your mods into the game.
> You need Java to run Forge.
> Download [Forge for 1.8.9](<https://maven.minecraftforge.net/net/minecraftforge/forge/1.8.9-11.15.1.2318-1.8.9/forge-1.8.9-11.15.1.2318-1.8.9-installer.jar>).
> When you double-click the file, install as client.
> If Forge does not open with Java, download [Jarfix](<https://johann.loefflmann.net/en/software/jarfix/index.html>), double-click it, then try running Forge again.

> **4: Download NEU**
> NEU is NotEnoughUpdates, another Forge mod that contains files that SkyHanni depends on to function.
> You can install it from any of those spots:
> - [Modrinth](<https://modrinth.com/mod/notenoughupdates>)
> - [Moulberry's Bush Discord Server](<https://discord.gg/moulberry>) in the channel [#neu-download](<https://discord.com/channels/516977525906341928/693586404256645231>) 
> - [SkyHanni Discord](<https://discord.com/invite/skyhanni-997079228510117908>) in the channel #neu-updates.

> **5: Download SkyHanni**
> SkyHanni has two different update circles: [Full Release](<https://github.com/hannibal002/SkyHanni/releases/latest>) and [Beta](<https://github.com/hannibal002/SkyHanni/releases>).
> It is recommended to use the **Full Release**.
> It updates every 3â€“4 weeks and should run very stable.
> If you find bugs or miss features in the full version, they might be fixed/implemented already in a beta version.
> The **Beta Version**, on the other hand, gets updated multiple times a week, has new features earlier, but may also contain more bugs.

> **6: Find .minecraft**
> Once you have downloaded both NEU and SkyHanni, you need to navigate to your `.minecraft` folder.
> - On Windows, open File Explorer, in the file location bar at the top type in `%appdata%` and open `.minecraft`.
> - On Mac, open Finder, click on "Go" at the top of your screen and then "Go to Folder" and type in `~/Library/Application Support/Minecraft`.
> - On Linux, `.minecraft` is located in your home folder. `~/.minecraft`

> **7: Move mods into mods folder**
> If there is a `mods` folder, great! Open it.
> Otherwise, create a new folder and name it exactly `mods`.
> Move the NEU and SkyHanni files you downloaded into the folder.
> Remove older versions of NEU or SkyHanni in that folder before adding the new files.
> *Note: If you encounter a problem, support may ask for a screenshot of your mods folder: this is the folder you just set up.*

> **8: Setup RAM**
> If you're running mods, you also need to set up your RAM.
> If you don't know how much RAM your computer has, follow [this guide](<https://www.howtogeek.com/435644/how-to-see-how-much-ram-is-in-your-pc-and-its-speed/>).
> To allocate RAM, go to Installations, press the 3 dots next to the installation you are using, click edit, and press the `More Options` button.
> In JVM arguments, look for something that says `-Xmx2G` or some other number followed by `G`.
> - If you have 4GB, allocate 2GB.
> - If you have 8GB or more, allocate 4GB.
> You generally don't need more than 4GB unless you are using an extensive number of mods.

> **9: Launch the Forge profile in the launcher**
> Installing Minecraft Forge should have set the profile for you, but if it didn't, go to installations, select new installation, and under version, find Forge for 1.8.9 (most likely at the top or bottom).

> **10: Recommended additional mods (optional)**
> [OptiFine](<https://optifine.net/adloadx?f=preview_OptiFine_1.8.9_HD_U_M6_pre2.jar>) and either [Sk1erLLC's Patcher](<https://sk1er.club/mods/patcher>) or [Polyfrost's PolyPatcher](<https://modrinth.com/mod/patcher>) (a fork of Patcher with OneConfig, slightly different features, and bug fixes, including fixed cactus hitboxes).
> Those two mods help you get more FPS in-game and let you change many more performance settings.
